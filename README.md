# Calculator
A simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* DE button to delete the last digit
* Evaluates the expression and shows the result when you press the "=" button

## How to run
To run the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Code Overview
The HTML file contains the structure and design of the calculator. It includes a display where the expression is displayed, and buttons for performing various operations.

The CSS file provides the styling for the calculator, using the Roboto font and a gradient background.

The JavaScript file uses event listeners to listen to button clicks, and performs the necessary actions based on the button id. The expression is evaluated using the `eval()` function.
